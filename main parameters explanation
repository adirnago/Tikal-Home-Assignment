repo_token: this is how Code Inspector can access your repository
code_inspector_access_key and code_inspector_access_key: this is how the action can communicate with the Code Inspector analysis engine.
min_quality_grade: the minimum grade your project should have. Valid values are: EXCELLENT, GOOD, NEUTRAL, WARNING, CRITICAL
min_quality_score: the minimum code quality score your project should have. This is a value between 0 and 100.
max_defects_rate: the number of defects per line of code. For example, the value 0.001 means 1 defect per 1000 lines of codes.
max_complex_functions_rate: the rate of complex functions (e.g. functions with high cyclomatic complexity). For example, a value of 0.5 means that the code should not have more than 50% of functions with high complexity.
max_long_functions_rate: the rate of long functions (e.g. functions that are too long to be correctly read by developers). For example, a value of 0.4 means that the code should not have more than 40% of long functions.
project_name: the name of the project on Code Inspector. This argument is optional: if you set a project name, the analysis engine will use the preferences of this project. Leave blank for not using a project.
max_timeout_sec: how many seconds the analysis should come back to you. Default is 600 secconds (10 minutes.)
